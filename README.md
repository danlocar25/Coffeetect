## Overview
Coffeetect is our Capstone Project, titled "An Android-based Mobile Application for Arabica Coffee Leaf Disease Detection through Digital Image Processing using Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm." This application is designed to assist coffee farmers and agricultural experts by detecting diseases on Arabica coffee leaves and assessing the severity level of the detected diseases.

## Features
- Disease Detection: Utilizes digital image processing to identify various diseases affecting Arabica coffee leaves.
- Severity Assessment: Determines the severity level of the detected diseases, providing crucial information for appropriate intervention.
- User-Friendly Interface: Built as an Android application, making it accessible and easy to use for farmers and agricultural professionals.

##Tech Stack
The project is developed using the following technologies and tools:
- Java: For developing the Android application.
- Python: For implementing machine learning models and image processing.
- Android Studio: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for Android app development.
- TensorFlow Lite: A lightweight machine learning framework used to deploy the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on mobile devices.
- Google Colab: A cloud-based platform used for training and testing machine learning models.
- Firebase: Provides backend services like database, authentication, and storage for the mobile application.
